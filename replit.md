# ProofCaptcha

## Overview

ProofCaptcha is an advanced proof-of-work based CAPTCHA system designed to protect websites from automated bots using cryptographic challenges. Unlike traditional image-based CAPTCHAs, ProofCaptcha employs end-to-end encryption, multiple challenge types, and sophisticated bot detection mechanisms to provide modern, privacy-focused bot protection.

The system consists of a React-based frontend dashboard for developers to manage API keys and view analytics, an Express backend API for challenge generation and verification, and embeddable JavaScript widgets for integration into third-party websites.

- Fixed `ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Changed from `location.split('?')[1]` to `window.location.search` for token parameter
- Issue: wouter's `useLocation()` hook only returns the path, not the query string, causing "Email tidak ditemukan" error even when backend successfully sent verification code

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React with TypeScript
- Vite as build tool and dev server
- Wouter for client-side routing
- TanStack Query for server state management
- shadcn/ui components (Radix UI primitives)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- i18next for internationalization (English/Indonesian)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Component Library:** Uses shadcn/ui (Radix UI) for accessible, customizable UI components following the "New York" style preset
- **State Management:** React Query handles all server state, eliminating the need for Redux/Zustand
- **Routing:** Wouter provides lightweight client-side routing without React Router overhead
- **Theming:** Custom theme system with light/dark modes using CSS variables and Tailwind
- **Build Output:** Compiled to `dist/public` for static file serving by Express

**Authentication Flow:**
- Session-based authentication using Express session middleware
- Email verification system with verification codes
- Password reset functionality with time-limited codes
- Protected routes checked via `requireAuth` middleware

### Backend Architecture
